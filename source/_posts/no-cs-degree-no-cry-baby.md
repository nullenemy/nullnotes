Hacker News 靠一己之力提升了全球互联网评论留言区的整体水准。在 [No CS Degree - Interviews with self-taught developers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20506945) 中作者 methodover 写到自己的宗教学背景可能对实际上的编程工作更有帮助：

>I have a religious studies degree.

>I wonder if it’s prepared me better than a CS degree for the actual work I do.

>What did I learn with my RELS degree? Hermeneutics— understanding ancient texts written by lots of different authors in their original historical contexts, often which has been deeply redacted over time. Anyone who’s worked on any production code can see the benefit of being trained in that kind of thinking.

>The classes I took on theology and philosophy helped train my brain to organize ideas. I had no trouble understanding object oriented programming — Plato would’ve loved it too, I think.

>Classes on ethics have come in handy too.

>Oh and just, we did a TON of writing in college. Lots and lots of writing, lots of research papers. I had to learn something new, read all about it, and put together a document carefully explaining the idea, with lots of evidence and citations. That skill has come in SUPER handy for everything from bug reports to API clients, to customer-facing documentation, to internal memorandums.
