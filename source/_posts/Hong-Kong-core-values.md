今天在卫报(the guardian)上看到了一篇关于香港抗议新闻的评论:  
[Hong Kong's identity as a city of rights and freedom is under threat – so we protest](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/12/hong-kongs-identity-as-a-city-of-rights-and-freedom-is-under-threat-so-we-protest) 。有一段话非常清晰地串起了这几年香港人愤怒的根由。

作者认为，与大陆相比，香港的特殊性,从曾经的物质层面的富足，转变成了一种更深层次的“骄傲”：不受干涉的自由媒体，参与选举和公共事务的渠道，批评政府的自由，相对独立公正的司法体系，以及抗争的权利。而这些核心的价值，定义了“香港人”这一身份。从占中运动开始的一系列政治摩擦，都是由于对“香港人”这一身份消失的忧虑引起的。对于香港人来说，如果香港仅仅成为了大陆众多城市中的一个，那么香港就已经死了。作者的名字叫做Antony Dapiran 。他有本书,我想找来看看：[City of Protest: A Recent History of Dissent in Hong Kong](https://www.amazon.com/City-Protest-Specials-Antony-Dapiran-ebook/dp/B073GMJD1B/). 另外，企鹅出版社有[一系列关于香港的书籍](https://www.bookdepository.com/search?searchTerm=penguin+hong+kong&search=Find+book)，可以趁此机会找来看看。

> In the past, Hong Kong had distinguished itself on the basis of wealth: Hong Kong was rich, while the rest of China was struggling to bring its population out of poverty. However, over the twenty years since the handover in 1997, as Hong Kong’s economy has drifted and China’s boomed, that distinction has failed to hold. Pride rooted in materialism has been replaced by a deeper pride among Hong Kongers, based around the notion of “Hong Kong Core Values”, those rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong that distinguish it from the rest of China. Hong Kong Core Values include: a lively and unfettered media, the right to participate in the electoral and governing process, freedom to criticise the government, rule of law and due process, an independent judiciary, and, of course, the right to protest. “Hong Kong core values” has become the answer to the question: “What does it mean to be a Hong Konger?”

> The current proposed extradition law, by blurring the line between the Hong Kong and mainland justice systems, is seen as another attack on Hong Kong core values. The million people on Hong Kong’s streets on Sunday and those gathering again today are protesting not just against a theoretical risk of extradition to the opaque mainland criminal justice system; they are protesting a threat to their very identity as Hong Kongers. And by taking to the streets, they were expressing their dissatisfaction by exercising of one of those key rights and freedoms: I am a Hong Konger, therefore I protest.
